* Place Buy/Sell order with **stop-loss** option:
1. Place normal Bittrex buy/sell orders using this application.
2. You can add stop-loss option to every buy/sell order created within AltCoin application.
3. Stop-loss cancels the order and places a new sell order immediately if coin's price drops below chosen stop-loss value.
4. Stop-loss is market-proof. This allows stop-loss to be executed only, if the coin's last price was below stop-loss value and above given % of stop-loss value. Useful in case coin's value drops dramatically.

* Email notifications:
1. Notifies if state of the open orders changes.

* User friendly interface:

**Pre-requisites:**

* Git (optional if you don't want to contribute, just download  the repo from github)
* Install **Ruby** on your machine as script is written in ruby language.


* Go To my Github Repo, Download/ Clone It: [pump and dump bot](https://github.com/aqfaridi/pump_and_dump_bot)
   `git clone git@github.com:aqfaridi/pump_and_dump_bot.git`

* Navigate to the folder in your local machine, Edit **API_KEY** and **API_SECRET** in **bittrex_bot.rb** with your KEY and SECRET as generated above.

  ```
  API_KEY = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
  API_SECRET = "<YOUR_API_SECRET>"
  ```

* Run the **bot script** using following command in terminal/ command prompt: 

```
ruby bittrex_bot.rb "COIN_CODE", "BOT_TYPE"
```

There are seven types of BOT as follows: 

1. **BUY BOT** which purchase the coin, taking care of coin not being prepumped, BOT_TYPE=1
      e.g For Siacoin(SC), Run like this : `ruby bittrex_bot.rb "SC" "1"`

2. **SELL BOT** which place sell order at given percent decrease as compared to last price of the market , BOT_TYPE=2
      e.g For Siacoin(SC), Run like this : `ruby bittrex_bot.rb "SC" "2"`

3. **BUY_AND_SELL BOT** which purchase the coin at minimum price and place the sell order at increment profits, BOT_TYPE=3
      e.g For Siacoin(SC), Run like this : `ruby bittrex_bot.rb "SC" "3"`


**Tuning of Parameters in Bot Script:**

1. Open **bittrex_bot.rb**, navigate to the end of file :  Change these lines according to the instructions below => 

```
buy_bot(0.05, 0.006, 0.5) if BOT_TYPE == 1
sell_order = sell_bot(0.1) if BOT_TYPE == 2
buy_sell_bot(0.05, 0.012, 0.5, 0.1, 2) if BOT_TYPE == 3
sell_at_any_cost(0.3) if BOT_TYPE == 4
buy_all_bot(0.05, 0.006, 0.5) if BOT_TYPE == 5
sell_all_bot(0.2) if BOT_TYPE == 6
cancel_all_bot if BOT_TYPE == 7
```



> **BUY BOT** has three parameters:


```
# method to place BUY order
# params: 
# percent_increase(float) - BUY price will be percent_increase of last_price of the market i.e BUY_PRICE = (1.0 + percent_increase)*last_price
# chunk(float) - Amount of BTC to invest for buying altcoin i.e BUY IF [last_price < (1.0 + prepump_buffer)*low_24_hr]
# prepump_buffer(float) -  Allowed buffer for prepump
def buy_bot(percent_increase = 0.05, chunk = 0.006, prepump_buffer = 0.5)
```

* You can pass values as per the need, for example :

`buy_bot(0.05, 0.01, 0.5) if BOT_TYPE == 0`  means you want to purchase coin with **5%** increase of the last price of the market with **0.01 BTC** having *prepump_buffer* of **50%** meaning if coin is prepumped more than **50%** of the last 24-hour low then you won't buy. 

> **SELL BOT** has one parameter:

```
# method to place SELL order
# params:
# percent_decrease(float) - BUY price will be percent_decrease of last_price of the market, eg. SELL_PRICE = (1.0 - percent_decrease)*last_price
def sell_bot(percent_decrease = 0.1)
```

* Change *percent_decrease* as per the need : 

`sell_order = sell_bot(0.1) if BOT_TYPE == 2` means you want to sell all the available coins with **10%** decrease of the last price of the market.


> **BUY_AND_SELL BOT** has five parameters:

```
# method to place BUY and SELL order immediately after purchase
# params :
# percent_increase(float)  ->  BUY_PRICE = (1.0 + percent_increase) * last_price
# chunk(float)  -> Amount of BTC to invest for buying altcoin
# prepump_buffer(float) -  Allowed buffer for prepump
# profit(float) -> SELL_PRICE = (1.0 + profit) * BUY_PRICE
# splits(int) -> How many splits of available quantity you want to make [profit] increment each time in next sell order
def buy_sell_bot(percent_increase = 0.05, chunk = 0.004, prepump_buffer = 0.5, profit = 0.2, splits = 2)

```
* You can pass values as per the need, for example :

`buy_sell_bot(0.05, 0.012, 0.5, 0.1, 2) if BOT_TYPE == 3` means you want to purchase coin with **5%** increase of the last price of the market with **0.012 BTC** having *prepump_buffer* of **50%** meaning if coin is prepumped more than **50%** of the last 24-hour low then you won't buy. Immediately, 2(splits) Sell orders will be placed with **10%** profit of the buy price in first order, next sell order will be placed with **20%** profit in incremental manner based on number of *splits*.

You can change the number of sell order by passing **splits** (last parameter), but remember **0.005 BTC** is the minimum amount required to place a sell order i.e if you keep *splits* as 10 then you need to invest **0.05 BTC** as *chunk*.


> **SELL_AT_ANY_COST BOT** has one parameter:

```
# method to place SELL order by cancelling all open orders
# params:
# percent_decrease(float) - BUY price will be percent_decrease of last_price of the market, eg. SELL_PRICE = (1.0 - percent_decrease)*last_price
def sell_at_any_cost(percent_decrease)
```
* Change *percent_decrease* as per the need : 

`sell_at_any_cost(0.3) if BOT_TYPE == 4` means you want to cancel all open orders and place one sell order at **30%** decrease of the last traded price of the market.

> **BUY_ALL BOT** has same parameters as that of **BUY BOT**.

> **SELL_ALL BOT** has one parameter: 
```
# method to sell all BTC pair orders on bittrex
# params- profit_rate(float)[default = 0.2] at which sell orders need to be set
def sell_all_bot(profit_rate = 0.2)
```
* Change *profit_rate* as per the need : 

`sell_all_bot(0.2) if BOT_TYPE == 6` means you want to place sell orders with **20%** profit on the net purchased value

> **CANCEL_ALL BOT** has no parameters as its task is only to cancel all open orders.

**Possible Strategies:**

1. Run **BUY Bot** and then go to Bittrex Trading page, Watch BIDs and ASKs, once you realise that momentum is decreasing, Run **SELL Bot** at that moment which will book your profit.  - *This strategy requires manual intervention*

2. Run **BUY_AND_SELL Bot** and then go to Bittex Trading page, Watch if your sell orders got executed or not, If not and momentum is decreasing then Run **SELL_AT_ANY_COST Bot**, If Yes then you already made your profit :)

3. Run **BUY_ALL Bot** and then Run **SELL_ALL Bot** at given profit, No need to monitor, once a coin being pumped or attain let say 20% gain, sell order will be executed automatically. [*For changing the profit of **SELL_ALL Bot**, Run **CANCEL_ALL Bot**, and then again  Run **SELL_ALL Bot** with different profit*]

**Future Scope:**

* Extending it detect pump or momentum in the crypto pair.
* Take trade entry / exit on the basis of RSI/MACD/OBV indicators, Run it as Cron job on the server to automate the process.
